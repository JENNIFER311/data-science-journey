# ML Mini Projects

This folder contains a collection of small machine learning projects that I am building while learning and practicing ML concepts.  
Each project focuses on a specific algorithm or technique.

## Projects Overview

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Classification using distance-based learning.
   - Simple but powerful for small datasets.

2. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Unsupervised learning algorithm for grouping data.
   - Useful for pattern discovery.

3. **Naive Bayes**
   - Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
   - Commonly used in text classification.

4. **Regression**
   - Predicting continuous values.
   - Includes Linear Regression and possibly other variations.

5. **Q-Learning**
   - Reinforcement learning algorithm.
   - Helps agents learn optimal policies through trial and error.

## Goal

The main goal of these mini projects is to:
- Strengthen understanding of core ML algorithms  
- Practice implementation in Python  
- Build a foundation for larger projects in the future
